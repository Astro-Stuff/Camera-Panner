# Camera-Panner
- remote control + receiver $5 on eBay: https://github.com/Astro-Stuff/Camera-Panner/blob/main/remote.jpg
- Arduino board $3 on eBay
- motor driver board $3 on eBay: L298N
- servo motor $5 from eBay  (Futaba 3003 is a cheap one). Must be converted into a simple DC motor:
      - Remove the servo electronics and power the motor directly from L298N
      - modify the servo gear so it can rotate continously by clipping the gear stopper that limits the rotation - movies available on youtube
